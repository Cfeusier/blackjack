# Blackjack in CoffeeScript and Backbone

This is a project I completed during a two-day sprint while studying at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This app was built with a pair, using CoffeeScript and Backbone. The objective of this project was to build a feature-complete Blackjack game using CoffeeScript while fully-utilizing the event-system of Backbone.
